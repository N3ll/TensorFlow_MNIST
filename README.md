# TensorFlow model using the MNIST dataset  

The notebook is created as an assignment for the course  [The Data Science Course 2019: Complete Data Science Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/the-data-science-course-complete-data-science-bootcamp/) and below is the introduction to the problem:  

The dataset is called MNIST and refers to handwritten digit recognition. You can find more about it on Yann LeCun's website (Director of AI Research, Facebook). He is one of the pioneers of what we've been talking about and of more complex approaches that are widely used today, such as covolutional neural networks (CNNs).

The dataset provides 70,000 images (28x28 pixels) of handwritten digits (1 digit per image).

The goal is to write an algorithm that detects which digit is written. Since there are only 10 digits (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9), this is a classification problem with 10 classes.

The goal is to creat a neural network model that identifies the digits.
